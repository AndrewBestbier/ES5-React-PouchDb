# FirstCouchPouch Spec

###Problem Introduction
Create a basic survey that asks 5 questions. 
Possible questions could be: 

  - Rate your JS level
  - What frameworks do you use?

###Problem requirements
  - Save the answers to these questions.
  - Display all results for each question.
  - Build as a single page app with React and PouchDB
  - Use webpack on the backend with a basic hapi or express.js app that serves the app
  - Then you can use PouchDBâ€™s map/reduce to summaries the data and display it
  - If you can build that along with some nice tests using mocha you will be ready to go
